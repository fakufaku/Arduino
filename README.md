# Arduino Safecast

This is a modified version of the Arduino environment. The main differences with the normal Arduino IDE are:

* Patched SD library to be compatible with any board that has a hardware variant defined,

* Includes [chibiArduino](https://github.com/fakufaku/chibiArduino) to use the 802.15.4 radio on the freakduino and bGeigie,

* Includes [CmdArduino](https://github.com/fakufaku/CmdArduino) to send commands to an Arduino device over serial,

* Includes [mighty-1284p](https://github.com/fakufaku/mighty-1284p) hardware variants that make the Arduino compatible with Atmel ATmega1284p microcontroller.

# Arduino

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free.

INSTALLATION
Detailed instructions are in reference/Guide_Windows.html and
reference/Guide_MacOSX.html.  For Linux, see the Arduino playground:

CREDITS
Arduino is an open source project, supported by many.

The Arduino team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe,
Gianluca Martino, Daniela Antonietti, and David A. Mellis.

Arduino uses the GNU avr-gcc toolchain, avrdude, avr-libc, and code from
Processing and Wiring.
